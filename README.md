# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
A simple review I did of the major Data Structures and Algorithms. Major data structures and algorithms (sorting, searching, lists, stacks, queues, hashtables, trees, etc.) are implemented. I am also currently working through problems of Craking the Code Interview, and those solutions are included here as well, along with their annotated space and time complexity. Everything is implemented in Java. 

The goal of this was to help prepare myself for programming interviews by recapping myself on important DS&A concepts. Feel free to use anything you find useful.
