# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
A simple review I did of the major Data Structures and Algorithms. All implemented in Java. I have also begun solving problems from Cracking the Code Interview (5th edition) and including them here as well.

The goal of this was to help prepare myself for programming interviews by recapping myself on important DS&A concepts. Feel free to use anything you find useful.
